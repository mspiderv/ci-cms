# Version 1.3

# Improvements/additions:

- Improved Opera support:
	- Previous versions relied on browser sniffing to detect Opera(older versions of Opera don't support right-click event overrides).
	  The new version relies on feature-detection as described here: http://perfectionkills.com/detecting-event-support-without-browser-sniffing/.
	- The event and operaEvent properties can be set to both a modifier and the actual event like this: 'ctrl+click'.
	  The contextmenu can now be invoked by pressing and holding Ctrl and clicking the left mouse button.
	  This improvement was suggested by Roman Imankulov (www.netangels.ru). 
	- The default value of the operaEvent property changed from 'dblclick' to 'ctrl+click'.
- When using livequery(by setting options.livequery to true and including a reference to livequery), menu items are now also bound by livequery.
  This enables dynamically adding menu items to an already initialized menu.
- The onShow callback receives two additional parameters: 'startLeft' and 'startTop'.
  The parameters contain the location where the contextmenu is about to show/fade-in.
  Previous versions overrode the e.pageX and e.pageY properties of the original event object e with the location of the menu, which wasn't good practice.
- Added option 'openBelowContext'.
  Default undefined.  
  When set to true, instead of opening at the clicked position the contextmenu opens at the lowerleft corner of the context.
  The first level of the menu automatically maintains its vertical position regardless of height overflow and window resizes.
  This feature can be used to create a contextmenu opened by a button, or to create multilevel dropdown menus.
- Added option 'ignoreWidthOverflow'.
  Default undefined.
  When set to true, width overflow is ignored which causes the menu to expand across the right boundary of the window.
- Added option 'ignoreHeightOverflow'.
  Default undefined. 
  When set to true, height overflow is ignored which causes the menu to expand across the bottom boundary of the window.
- Added option 'startLeftOffset'.
  Default 0.
  This value is added to the left position where the menu is about to show/fade-in.
- Added option 'startTopOffset'.
  Default 0.
  This value is added to the top position where the menu is about to show/fade-in.
- Added option 'keyboard'.
  Default true. 
  When set to false, the menu doesn't respond to keyboard events.
- Added option 'autoHide'.
  Default undefined. 
  When set to true, the whole menu hides after the mouse pointer exits the menu.
  The delay property controls the time between exiting the menu and hiding the menu.
